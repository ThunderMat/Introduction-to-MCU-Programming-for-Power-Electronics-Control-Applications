## Introduction to Microcontroller Programming for Power Electronics Control Applications
This repository contains the MATLAB/Simulink source code to
reproduce the experiments presented in the book: 
"[Introduction to Microcontroller Programming for Power Electronics Control Applications](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003196938/introduction-microcontroller-programming-power-electronics-control-applications-mattia-rossi-nicola-toscani-francesco-castelli-dezza-marco-mauri)" M.Rossi, N.Toscani, M.Mauri, F.Castelli-Dezza.

The book covers the mathematical modeling, parameters estimation, control scheme design and related real-time implementation for power electronic-based applications. These concepts are illustrated by adopting C2000 LaunchPad MCU family from Texas Instruments and an automatic code generation tool able to translate Simulink schemes into executable files.

and put a star :star: to keep an eye on future commits. 



## Running experiments
Experiments (simulation and implementation) are split in root folders referring to the book chapters.
The m-files including parameters initialization have to be executed before simulation or code generation.  

>Required:  
>MATLAB 2018b or newer  
>Embedded Coder Support Package for TI C2000    
>TI controlSUITE and Code Composer Studio v6 or newer
