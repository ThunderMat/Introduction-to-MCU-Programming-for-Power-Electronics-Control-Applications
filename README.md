## Introduction to Microcontroller Programming for Power Electronics Control Applications
This repository contains the MATLAB/Simulink source code to
reproduce the experiments presented in the book: 
"[Introduction to Microcontroller Programming for Power Electronics Control Applications](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003196938/introduction-microcontroller-programming-power-electronics-control-applications-mattia-rossi-nicola-toscani-francesco-castelli-dezza-marco-mauri)"

The book covers mathematical modeling, parameters estimation, control scheme design and related real-time implementation for power electronic-based applications. These concepts are illustrated by adopting C2000 LaunchPad MCU family from Texas Instruments and an automatic code generation tool able to translate Simulink schemes into executable files.

## Running experiments
Experiments (simulation and implementation) are split in root folders referring to the book chapters.
m-files including parameters initialization have to be executed before simulation or code generation.  

>Required: MATLAB 2018b or newer
